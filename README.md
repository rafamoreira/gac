# GAC

## Git auto commit.

Simple program to speed up commits for single user repositories.

Many times I'm working in a repository that nobody is going to ever read a
commit message, this is helping with that.

Right now the implementation is very simple, it just adds all files and commits
with the sequential number of the commit.

## Usage

```bash
gac
```
